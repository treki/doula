                    <p class="text-muted">I was recently asked by a pregnant Momma what my philosophy as a doula was.  It is so simple, really:  The Mother is in charge.  My job is to "hold her space," making sure that her needs and desires are heard, ensuring that she feels loved and supported during her labor and birth, and helping her get any information that she needs.  My goal is to have every act and word on my part be in harmony with the goals of the parents.  I'm here to help.</p>

She was insightful with ideas and direction on how to deal with my pregnancy. Chloe's experience was exactly what I needed to have a successful "All natural vaginal birth"! I don't think I could have felt as strong as I did without her support.She was everything I needed and more, like having a trusted friend with the added benefits of doula training. She even wrote us our labor story and baked us some lactaion cookies after we had gone home from the birthing center. I'd definetly use her again when we deside to have another one. I would not hesitate to recommend Chloe to my friends and family, and would highly recommend her services to anyone. </p>

She had a bag of tricks and suggested various positions to labor positions that helped me get through each contraction. The birth of my 2nd daughter went better than I could have ever imagined! Prior to going into labor she met us several times and we went over some pain management techniques that were very helpful. After I gave birth she also came by for a visit and wrote up a beautiful story of my daughters birth that I will forever save in her baby book. <br>She really has a passion for what she does and is great at it, I would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a Doula! </p>

She has such a calm caring manner which put me at ease while managing to focus me on the task at hand. There were a few times I started to lose my focus and panic but she was right there at my side to boost my strength and help me cope.Chloe was there for us throughout the whole experience. She was on the phone checking on me once I let her know contractions had started and came over once we were sure they were progressing to help us labor at home for a while. She was great at suggesting new positions to try and to make sure I changed these positions often to help things along. After my water broke at 12:30 am we labored a little longer before going to the hospital where it seemed to take forever to be admitted. The bed was very uncomfortable in triage where they only let one person be with you and my husband couldn't seem to comfort me like I was needing so he had Chloe come back to help me. This was much appreciated once she came in and helped me with counter pressure and reminders to breath and that this contraction would be over soon making what felt overwhelming at that moment seem like much less of a mountain to climb.Once we were admitted I was having back to back contractions and felt the need for an epidural which I don't know if I could have stayed still enough to get if Chloe wasn't there to help me manage the intensity of those contractions. Things went pretty smooth from there though it was a very long day she was there for me every step of the way. My son was born after 37 minutes of pushing with constant encouragement and hand holding at 7:37 pm. I will definitely hire Chloe again if we have a future pregnancy, I feel blessed to have found her for this one!</p>

I loved Chloe's gentle energy as soon as I met her. I appreciated the time she took getting to know me before the birth and we talked a lot about different techniques to deal with pain. I ended up having back labor and it was much harder than I expected but Chloe was so helpful. She had lots of ideas of different positions to try, she spent a lot of time rubbing my legs and feet since they ached through the contractions and she helped so much with my breathing. She manages to be soft-spoken and gentle, yet provides a strong presence which kept me grounded when things became overwhelming. When I was sure I couldn't get through another contraction she was my cheerleader, reminding me of the end goal and of my own strength. I am so grateful I found her and had her with me during my intense birth experience. She really was there for me every step of the way.</p>
